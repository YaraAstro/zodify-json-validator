4. **View Real-Time Validation:**

### 3. Interface & Responsive Breakpoints

The web app is designed with a responsive interface that adapts to your device:

- **Mobile (up to 600px):**  
  The layout stacks vertically so that the JSON input, schema editor, and validation results are shown in a single column for easy reading and interaction.

- **Tablet (600px to 900px):**  
  The interface adjusts to display two columns. For example, the JSON input and schema editor might be side-by-side with the validation results displayed below.

- **Desktop (above 900px):**  
  A multi-pane layout is used where you can see:
  - The JSON input on the left,
  - The schema editor in the middle,
  - The live validation output on the right.
  
This design ensures that regardless of your device, you get a seamless and productive validation experience.
